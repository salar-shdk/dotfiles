# my_openbox_configuration

"templates/" contains tint2, conky, openbox theme and rofi configurations!

color_scheme.py is a script that picks a random picture form "~/Pictures/wallpapers/" and set as background.
then using wal, generates new configurations and restarts tint2, conky, theme and rofi with new config files!
